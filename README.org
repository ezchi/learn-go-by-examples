* My journey of learning Go
This journey start with follow https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/.

** Getting started
*** Hello World
**** Create the directory
#+begin_src sh
  mkdir hello
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

**** Enable dependency tracking for the code
To enable the tracking by create the =go.mod= file, run the =go mod
init= command as below with =example/hello= as name of this example
code.

#+begin_src sh :dir ./hello
  go mod init example/hello
#+end_src

**** First code
The first hello world code is in [[file:hello/main.go][hello/main.go]]

**** Run the first code with =go run= command
#+begin_src sh :dir ./hello :results org
  go run .
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src org
Hello, World!
#+end_src

*** Call code in external package
This session will learn how to add external package as example and call code in that package.
